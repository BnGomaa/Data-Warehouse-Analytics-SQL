# Data Warehouse Analytics (SQL Reporting) 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced **SQL Querying** skills to extract actionable business insights from a data warehouse.

As a Data Analyst, my focus was to explore the `Gold` schema (pre-processed data), validate data quality, and generate consolidated reports for stakeholders without relying on visualization tools.

## 🛠 Analyst Skills Demonstrated
* **Complex Data Extraction:** Writing optimized T-SQL queries to answer specific business questions.
* **Data Profiling:** Investigating data quality, date ranges, and column distributions to ensure accuracy.
* **Aggregated Reporting:** Creating unified KPI views using `UNION ALL` to summarize Sales, Orders, and Customer metrics in one output.
* **Advanced Ranking:** utilizing Window Functions (`TOP N`, `ORDER BY`) to identify:
    * Best & Worst performing products.
    * High-value customers (Pareto Principle).

## 📊 Key Insights Extracted
* **Revenue Drivers:** Identified the top 5 products contributing to the majority of sales.
* **Customer Behavior:** Segmented customers based on order frequency and purchase volume.
* **Market Trends:** Analyzed sales performance across different countries and product categories.

## 📂 Project Structure
* **`Advanced_Business_Reporting.sql`**: The script containing the analysis logic, organized into:
    1.  **Exploratory Analysis:** Understanding the dataset.
    2.  **KPI Calculation:** High-level metrics.
    3.  **Deep-Dive Analysis:** Detailed performance reports.

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  Open the SQL file in any SQL editor (SSMS, Azure Data Studio).
2.  Review the queries to see how raw data is transformed into business answers.
